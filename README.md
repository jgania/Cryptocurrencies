# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. The analysis will use unsupervised learning to group the cryptocurrencies and create a classification system for the new investment portfolio. The assignment consists of four technical analysis parts:

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA: using Pandas, preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA.
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the dataset to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means: create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the reduced dataset, and then run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results: use data visualization to share the findings with the clients.
